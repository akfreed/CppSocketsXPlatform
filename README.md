This solution contains a cross-platform API for sockets in C++11. It works on Windows and Posix systems.

There are five projects. Two of them are libraries, and three of them are executables. The sockets library is the part to check out. It can be found under windows/ and posix/. CMake will include the appropriate source, depending on what platform you are building on. The other library contains the code for TCP and UDP echoservers. 

This project uses CMake. CMake creates the makefile, then you use that makefile to build. CMake is cross platform and works with a wide range of compilers (e.g. MSVC, GCC, MinGW), operating systems (e.g. Windows, Linux), and IDEs (e.g. Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, Make). To use it, navigate to the directory with the bottommost CMakeList.txt file. Add a new directory. Go into the directory and type "cmake ..". On Linux, for example, this might create a Makefile. You can then type "make" to build the project. On Windows, this might create a Visual Studio solution. You can open the solution and compile.
